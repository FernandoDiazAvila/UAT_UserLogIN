<!--                        Fernando Diaz Avila's Assignment
    What do I need to have?;
        Inputs for User first and last name. Check if the string is greater than >20 
        characters and give a warning – but do not continue the program if invalid.
        Inputs for User badge number, Check if badge number is valid and 3 digits– 
        but do not continue the program if invalid. 

    Planning:
       I will reseach How to meet the requirements of the request. Than apply a function
       to recieve the users Input correctly before loading the website. After proper input,
       have the program display that users input on the webpage.

    What can I do to improve for next time?
        I will like to try finding the font that the alarm clocks have to be only for 
        the time and attempt to add sound for the countdown and warnings. And figure out
        why my countdown is going up?

    <!--I can enxure that the function will keep looping by adding a while loop statment for each if
